# Crystals
A simulation of crystals using particles.
The blue particles are the ones that can form crystals. The green ones just bounce them around.
When two blue particles collide ( one can be  in a crystal ) they stop moving and fom a crystal.
If the crystals grow too large ( lag exceeds a crtain threshold ) , the simulation restarts.
